<p id="MCL-333-27961-d">(d) No marihuana establishment may refuse representatives of the department the right during the hours of operation to inspect the licensed premises or to audit the books and records of the marihuana establishment.</p>

<p id="MCL-333-27961-2">(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an individual who suffers damage or is personally injured by a minor or visibly intoxicated person as a result of a violation of subsection (1), if the violation is a proximate cause of the damage or personal injury or death, shall have a right of action in his or her name against the licensee that sold or transferred the marihuana.</p>

A person shall give written notice to all defendants within 120 days after entering an attorney-client relationship for the purposes of pursuing a claim for damages under this section.

<p id="MCL-333-27961-7">(7) It is presumed that a licensee, other than the licensee that last sold or transferred marihuana to a minor or visibly intoxicated person, is not a proximate cause of an injury that gave rise to a cause of action under subsection (2). This presumption may be overcome by clear and convincing evidence.</p>
<p id="MCL-333-27961-8">(8) A minor or alleged visibly intoxicated individual does not have a cause of action under this section. A person does not have a cause of action against a licensee for any loss or damage sustained resulting from the injury or death of the minor or visibly intoxicated person.</p>
<p id="MCL-333-27961-9">(9) An individual who suffers damage or who is personally injured by a minor or visibly intoxicated person as a result of a violation of subsection (1) has the right to recover actual damages in a sum of not less than $50.00 in each case in which the court or jury determines that intoxication was a proximate cause of the damage, injury, or death.</p>

<p id="MCL-333-27961-12">(12) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a civil action against a licensee is subject to the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.101 to 600.9947.</p>
