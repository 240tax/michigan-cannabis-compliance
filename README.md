# Michigan Cannabis Compliance Knowledge Hub

This repository is a public, open-source resource hub for Michigan cannabis compliance, built for advocates, businesses, researchers, and the public. It cross-links authoritative regulatory documents from the Michigan Cannabis Regulatory Agency (CRA) with plain-language articles and a semantic index for easy discovery.

## What’s Inside

- **Authoritative Documents:**  
  Official statutes, rules, and guidance from the Michigan Cannabis Regulatory Agency. Includes the Michigan Compiled Laws (MCL) in HTML format for easy navigation, as well as PDF regulatory documents.

- **Articles:**  
  50+ original articles previously published on Substack, explaining Michigan cannabis compliance topics in plain language, referencing the authoritative documents.

- **Semantic Index Hub:**  
  A living, cross-linked index connecting topics, articles, and authoritative sources for easy exploration and semantic (meaning-based) search or discovery.

## Project Goals

- Make Michigan cannabis compliance information open, accessible, and easy to navigate.
- Cross-link every article with the relevant laws, rules, and official guidance.
- Help users (including AEOs and search engines) discover content via a well-structured semantic index.
- Provide a model for compliance/documentation projects in other legal fields.
