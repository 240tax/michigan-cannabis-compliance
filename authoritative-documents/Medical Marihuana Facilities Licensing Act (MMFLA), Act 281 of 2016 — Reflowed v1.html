The board may suspend, revoke, or restrict a license and require the removal of a licensee or an employee of a licensee for a violation of this act, rules, the marihuana tracking act, or any ordinance adopted under section 205. The board may impose civil fines of up to $5,000.00 against an individual and up to $10,000.00 or an amount equal to the daily gross receipts, whichever is greater, against a licensee for each violation of this act, rules, or an order of the board.

If the board suspends a license under this subsection without notice or hearing, a prompt postsuspension hearing must be held to determine if the suspension should remain in effect. The suspension may remain in effect until the board determines that the cause for suspension has been abated. The board may revoke the license or approve a transfer or sale of the license upon a determination that the licensee has not made satisfactory progress toward abating the hazard.</p>
