Link Stability & Versioning
Link to “latest” when you need a living reference that updates over time:

Example: laws/mrtma/latest/index.html

If/when a new version is published, add a dated directory alongside latest (e.g., 2025-07/) and update latest to point at the newest HTML. This keeps:

Stable permalinks for living articles (latest)

Immutable citations for past versions (laws/mrtma/2025-07/index.html)

How to Cite (suggested)
Act/Rule/Doc title §/R section (ed. YYYY-MM), Michigan Cannabis Compliance — Source Library, link to the specific file (prefer immutable dated path when available).

Example:
“MRTMA §8 (ed. 2025-07), Michigan Cannabis Compliance — Source Library, laws/mrtma/2025-07/index.html.”
